Hi PERSON_NAME,

We've recently upped our security game over at Aurison. As part of this initiative, a stronger password policy has been implemented and we require all users to update their passwords.

PERSON_LINK

Ensure you update your password through the update link (you may need to copy and paste it in a web browser) above within the next two days to avoid any interruption in your account access. Accounts that aren't updated within this timeframe will be automatically disabled.

Thank's for your understanding,
Team Aurison
